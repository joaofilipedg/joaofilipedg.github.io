Hello! Welcome to my personal page. 

My name is João Guerreiro and in June 2020 I finished my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Universidade de Lisboa, in Lisbon, Portugal.
My thesis was on the topic of *DVFS Modeling for Energy-Efficient GPU Computing*, and my advisors were [Pedro Tomás](http://sips.inesc-id.pt/~pfzt/), [Nuno Roma](http://sips.inesc-id.pt/~nfvr/) and [Aleksandar Ilic](http://sips.inesc-id.pt/~ilic/).

During my PhD I was also a Junior Researcher at Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores R&D (INESC-ID).

Before that, I finished my MSc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering also at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal, in 2014.

My main topics of interest include **Parallel Programming**, **Machine Learning** and **Data-Science**.
